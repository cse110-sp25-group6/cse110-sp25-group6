## Overview

This document summarizes the current state and future plans for our CI/CD pipeline, implemented using **GitHub Actions**. The pipeline is designed to automate essential checks such as linting, testing, documentation, and code reviews to improve code quality and maintain development efficiency.

Our goal in Phase 1 is to build a foundational, testable CI process using experimental code and setup—not full production builds. This sets the groundwork for more sophisticated CI/CD functionality in later phases.
