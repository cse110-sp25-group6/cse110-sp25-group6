# Sprint Retrospective \- 5/25/25

## What went well?

* The homepage and collection team communicated in their respective teams to delegate new tasks and update on progress  
* Made some progress in the UI to represent the Miro drawing  
* Refined layout and cards, made some iterative improvements  
* Having a skeleton version of the pack opening, it can open one or five packs with animation

## What didnâ€™t go well?

* Team members had other academic and personal obligations, which reduced the amount of time and energy they could dedicate to the project  
* The homepage team met relatively late in the sprint, which limited their ability to iterate or course-correct before the sprint review  
* A consistent visual or conceptual theme for the cards has not been established yet

## Main Takeaways

* Made some progress in each team, but the project will have more depth once we have a theme  
* Better coordination across teams and earlier syncs will help maintain project velocity and reduce last-minute scrambles  
* Establishing a finalized theme for the card game is critical for maintaining design consistency and narrative direction

## Notes

* Have a consistent template for the project UI
