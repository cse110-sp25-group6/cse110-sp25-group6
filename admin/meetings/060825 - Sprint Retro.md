## What when well

- A lot more team communication going on since last sprint  
  - More consistent workflow  
- We started integrating all of our code into one branch. It was great to see our project finally come together as one.  
- Implementing keyboard control for the card inspect view was fun and satisfying.  
- Getting a lot of outside feedback

## What Didn't go well

- Rushed, Could have done a lot of things earlier or started earlier  
- Although we had a lot better communication this sprint, it could have been a little better; had some people working on the same task at one point because we weren’t specific about peoples’ roles.

## What we learned 

- We learned the importance of considering our app through the perspective of the user from talking with Professor Powell.   
- The value of communication was reinforced; improving our communication methods has enabled us to repay the debt we incurred from previous communication failures.  
- It is important to avoid judging people without trying to place yourself into their shoes. Others have their own struggles and motivations and it is important to be empathic to support them through their the problem
