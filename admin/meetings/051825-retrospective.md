# Sprint Retrospective - 5/18/25
## Agenda

- Sprint Retrospective

## What went well

- We were able to start creating the pack opening page and made important decisions regarding page layout and sequencing of elements.  
-  We were able to get started on our project and scaffold the basic layout of our page.  
- Created a foundation for the html and css pages for homepage  
- Effectively got our issues completed in a timely manner

## What didn't go so well?

- We could have better communication, and didn't have many conversations until the end of the sprint  
- We didn't communicate enough to work on our part together.  
- There were some doubts and uncertainties in how some components of the project should be implemented.  
- Could communicate better during the sprint  
- Had to get all work done in a couple sittings due to only really being able to work on files when every one was available

## Main Take Aways

- Through our first sprint we were able to learn a lot about the general structure of a sprint. We were able to get a lot of work done however there are also some things that we need to work on for future sprints. One of the main things would be to have better communication within sub teams as well as within the main team.
