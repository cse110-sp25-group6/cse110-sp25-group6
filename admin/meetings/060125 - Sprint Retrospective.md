# Sprint Retrospective \- 6/1/25

## What Went Well?

- I was very happy about making the card inspect feature. That was pretty cool :))  
- I was happy with the progress that we were able to make on the collection page as it looks pretty nice now.  
- There seemed to be an improvement in communication in the last week, with improvement in progress

## What didn't go well?

- Although communication improved, it seems like there could still be a bit more communication \- additional team meeting   
- Everything went well for me  
- Sad that one of our teammates didnâ€™t show up

## What improvements should we focus on

- Next sprint: Each group (homepage, collection, pack opening)  should collaborate with other groups and not stay in only their group. We are getting to the stage where we are going to start merging, so we need to keep in contact with each other  
- Next sprint we should focus on doing the same as we have cause the team dynamic is pretty good
