## Feedback on Submitted Project Pitch

- The project has a clear card-based theme, but it leans more toward design/aesthetics than technical complexity.
- Current features largely overlap with the first warmup assignment.
- Needs more **specificity** in terms of game mechanics:
  - How are credits distributed or used?
  - Do they recharge over time?
  - What are the rules for card combinations?
- Project seems like it could be completed too quickly; more technical depth is needed.
- Personas should reflect **real human needs**, not just feature desires.
