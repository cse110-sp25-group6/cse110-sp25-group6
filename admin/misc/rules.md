  - Project Managers need to clearly specify tasks
  - When delegated a task, make sure to ask questions and completely understand what the task is asking
  - If conflict get too out of hand see conflict between teams section
- Miscommunication about Goals (what we expect product to look like)
  - Solution: Have members meet up to rediscuss and redefine goals for project. If necessary, bring in a third party or the project managers to get an additional opinion.
- Conflict between teams (in terms of code, goals, ideas etc.)
  - Merge conflict resolution thing in vs code
  - solution: both groups meet together, discuss vision/discrepancies between ideas
- Disagreements between groups/pairs

  - solution: worst case scenario we can separate group members into new pairs/groups to work on different things.
