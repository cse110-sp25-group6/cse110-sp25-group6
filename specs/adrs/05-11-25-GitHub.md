# Use GitHub for Project Collaboration

## Context and Problem Statement

How can we easily collaborate on a large codespace?
How to keep track of the issues for the project?
How to make our code open-source and easily replicable?

## Considered Solutions/Options

* GitHub
* GitLab
* Bitbucket

## Decision:

We chose `GitHub` because of its large community and support as well as it's simplicity for working on projects with a large number of people.

## Pros

* Free for open source repositories
* Highly documented and large support from its community
* Many additional tools such as `GitHub Actions`

## Cons 

* Less control compared to a self-hosted Git
* Costs money if we ever make the repository private
