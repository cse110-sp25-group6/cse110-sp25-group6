Assigned Teams for Project

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to break down the Gacha Card Collector Game project into manageable components with clear objectives.

## Considered Solutions/Options

* Assign specific teams for core features: cards and home page, pack opening, collections.
* Assign teams based on frontend/backend
* Assign general tasks and have team members switch around

## Decision:

Assign specific teams for core features.

## Pros

* More focus on specific features
* Prevents confusion on who is working on what
* Easier to track progress

## Cons 

* Communication could be more difficult
* Less flexibility for members to work on what they want
* Could have delays if one team is dependent on another

## Examples/Any more important information
With the use of regular checkins, different teams should be on the same page and be able to streamline the development process.
